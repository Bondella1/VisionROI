# About Azure AD
Once student subscription expires, the azure service will be disabled unless you are in pay as you go subscription. You won't be charged unles you upgrade to a paid plan.
Azure AD authentication for localhost is free as long as you’re within the free tier limits.
However, once the offer expires, the Azure AD service will stop working, and your app’s authentication will break unless you upgrade.

The MSAL library supports React 18, not 19. Hence we uninstalled React 19 and installed React 18 to install MSAL library.
